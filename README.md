## About the Video Course
	
React Router is a frontend package that listens to changes in your URL and keeps your application in-sync by rendering the corresponding view components. It enables you to build a single-page web application that incorporates navigation without refreshing the page when the user navigates to it.
In this course, you will be introduced to React Router and create your first route using this React component. You will configure your routes by passing parameters and creating nested routes. By working with various React Router components, you will master their various configuration options and learn how to use the Redirect and Switch components.
By the end of this course, you will be ready to work with React Router and make routing configurations in a server-side, rendered React application.
